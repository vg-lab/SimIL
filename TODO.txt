1 what: TSpikes class needs safe concurrent read/write access.
  why: LoaderRESTData adds spikes to TSpikes class while other classes like
       SimulationPlayer uses (and keeps) iterators to access it. Iterators
       will be invalidated when the data is reallocated and that will surely
       happen as TSpikes only grows. ViSimpl histograms widgets also reads
       spikes concurrently. 
  how: Forced to use C++11 by CMakeCommon cant use C++17 mutexes, use
       boost::shared_mutex with boost::shared_lock and boost::unique_lock.
       Use std::distance to store iterators.
